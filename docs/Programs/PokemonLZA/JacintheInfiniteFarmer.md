### Instructions

1. Train a strong steel or poison type Pokémon that can defeat Jacinthe's high-level fairy type Pokémon.
2. Stand facing Jacinthe in Hotel Richissime with Button A icon visible.
3. Select the strong Pokémon so it will lead the battle.
4. Start the program in the game.

This program has 2 modes: With and without a battle AI.

**With Battle AI (new to v0.59.5):**

In this mode, the program will choose the move with the best type effectiveness against the opponents. In the event of a tie, they will chosen in this priority order:

- Top
- Left
- Right
- Bottom


**Without Battle AI:**

In this mode, the program will spam 3 moves in the following priority:

- Top
- Left
- Bottom

It will never use the Right move slot as that is the A button which interferes with parts of the program.


In both modes, if your Pokémon faints, it will automatically timeout and switch to the next Pokémon in your party. The move priority is the same for all members of your party.
