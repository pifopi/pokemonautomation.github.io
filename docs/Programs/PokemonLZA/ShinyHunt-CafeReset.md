# Shiny Hunt - Cafe Reset (Will Be in Next Beta, Not Released Yet)

See also: [Shiny Hunting Recommendations](ShinyHuntRecommendations.md)

## Program Description

Shiny hunt by repeatedly fast traveling to a cafe or other fast travel location outside Wild Zones. This will shiny hunt all spawns within 50m of the fast travel location. Unlike blind macros, this program will tolerate the day/night cycle and will detect audible shinies that are nearby.

This program is mostly for a single spawner: the alpha Swirlix near Nouveau Cafe (Truck No. 3). It also hunts a non-alpha Swirlix near the same cafe and a Dedenne/Emolga spawner near Magenta Pokémon Center.

To shiny hunt Pokémon in wild zones, use our [Shiny Hunt - Wild Zone Entrance](ShinyHunt-WildZoneEntrance.md) program.

With the Shiny Charm you will get a shiny Pokémon quite fast if there are many Pokémon spawned around you. Don't let the program run for too long or have old shinies overwritten by new ones.

Shiny sound detection will happen at most once to avoid detecting the same shiny Pokémon over and over.
