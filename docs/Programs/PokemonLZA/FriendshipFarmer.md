At the time of creating this, friendship in Pokémon LZA is only used for friendship-based evolutions. This happens at a friendship of 160. There are two options for automating your friendship standing, visiting a café or hanging out on a bench. To learn more about friendship in ZA: https://www.serebii.net/legendsz-a/friendship.shtml

Visiting a café is faster than hanging out on a bench for a single Pokémon. However, it costs money while sitting on a bench is free. A drink at a café can cost $250 to $100,000, the recommended café (Café Rouleau) costs $360. To learn more about the different cafés: https://www.serebii.net/legendsz-a/cafés.shtml

It takes ~13.5 minutes to evolve a full party using the café method. The bench method will only take ~7 minutes to evolve a full party as all party members gain standing simultaneously. If you only want to evolve a single Pokémon the café method only takes ~2.2 minutes.
