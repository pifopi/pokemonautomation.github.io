**Preparation for AZ's Floette:**

2. Proceed with the 15th reward battle against the rival, enter Quasartico Inc. for the first half of the dialog until your rival tries to give you AZ's Floette but can't due to the full box slots. <img src="images/StatsReset-AzFloette-FullParty2.png">
3. Set the guide pin to Quasartico Inc. so that opening the map from the main menu (X press then Plus press) placecs the cursor right above the Quasartico Inc. fly spot. <img src="images/StatsReset-AzFloette-FlySpot.png">
