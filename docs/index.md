## What is this?

Pokémon Automation is a project that strives to automate the Pokémon games.

### Why automate the game?

Certain aspects of Pokémon are very boring and tedious (such as shiny hunting). So rather than spending hundreds of hours grinding with manual gameplay, you have a bot do it for you. Thus the fun changes to managing the bots that play the game for you.

With automation, it becomes possible to play 24/7 and simultaneously on multiple devices without wasting too much of your own time. Thus with so much extra game time, it becomes possible to legitimately obtain extremely rare Pokémon that are normally only feasible via hacking.

### How does this work?

A computer with video capture and a custom game controller!

By capturing the video and audio using a capture card, a computer can see (and hear) everything that's happening on the Switch.

To control the Switch, we create our own 3rd party gamepad using a programmable microcontroller:

- Using a Raspberry Pi Pico W or an ESP32 microcontroller, we can make a joycon using the Bluetooth gamepad protocol.
- Using an ESP32-S3, we can make a wired pro controller using the USB gamepad protocol.

These custom controllers behave just like regular controllers. But rather than having buttons and joysticks that are pressed by a human, they are controlled electronically by a computer.

Since the computer can both see and control the Switch, it can take the place of a human player. But unlike a human, a computer doesn't eat or sleep. And it never gets tired or bored. So you can run it 24/7 for months on end hunting shinies for you!

### Examples:

Automatic detection of shiny encounters using visual recognition of the shiny sparkle animation.

## Supporting Us

As of this writing, we do not take donations of any kind for this project. The only support we request is by sharing our work with your friends if you have enjoyed using it.
In the spirit of transparency, we kindly ask that you disclose the use of automation when sharing photos or videos of Pokémon obtained using these programs.
This can be done simply by sharing a screenshot of the program with stats or with a text footer indicating it is done by automation.

If such a disclosure is not permissible, we ask that you avoid any explicit or implicit claims that such Pokémon were caught manually.
